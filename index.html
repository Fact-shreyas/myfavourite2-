          <h3>Drawing and coding are some of the activities that i do  to refresh my mind and it helps me to concentrate on studies.After the online classes i do drawing and coding .I do coding and drawing because due to covid-19 their is lockdown in my area and i can not go out to play or meet friends.So i have noting to do at home instead of studing but a person can't study for 24*7 and as per scientist we need around 8 to 9 hour of rest and 1 to 2 hour of meditation so i do drawing as a meditation and it really works because after it really do my studies quiet better .So after know it i do drawing as my regular activite.I also do coding because i want to make something which would help everyone and would help us to make our earth better and can face daily chanlenges.  </h3>
